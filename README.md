## Philosophy of _Flotsy_:
* Life is percisious
* Individuals are equally respectful
* Life should not be defined by rules
* Objectify belongings and desire
* Honesty to self and others.
* Support each other
* Resources belongs to all
* Open mind to all
* Sharing is Caring
* Unity
* >"happiness is only real when shared page"

## Why:
* We believe individual want to be seen as who they really are, and individual
  has the power of create his image to others.
* We think the current social media are isolating us with all non-essences.
* We think social media should help people connecting, growing, and complete
  each others.

## User Senario 1:
* Ann love fashion, she uploads all her clothes, shoes, and accessories, which
  represent her style, Flotsy is the reflection on her taste.
* Ann has a skill of picking the most trendy item, and really good at dressing
  up anyone. Flotsy allow Ann's talent discovered by other people.
* Ann cares about environment, she want to be more active in volunteering in
  environmental areas, but do not have the experinces, and little bit shy, she
  listed this in her _Want_ list, as a personal todo item.
* Ann always think mathematic is sort of black magic, she haven't been learning
  any of mathematics since graduation of high school, but she wants to expand
  her horizon and domian of her knowledge, but not fully commited to a degree or
  boring online course, what she want is some Mathematic wizard can causally chat with her more about the mathematics, so she put "Wish to learn more about math".

## User Senario 2:
  * Tom loves technologis, not only he own all the newest gadgets on the
    markets, but also has a nice collections of all the game consoles, he really
    want to let more people to know this, So he list all he's gadgets on the
    __Owned__.
  * Tom has a PhD in Mathematics and currently working in Google, he is very
    pround of himself, so he put this too.
  * Tom also is a environmental activist, had has been to many Greenpeace and Sea shepherd events, He love those experinces a lot.
  * Tom on the other hand, always want to upgrade his wardrobe, but do want to
    hire any professional (not causal enough and slight awkward), So her put
    "May need help with wardrob"
  * Everyday Tom meets all people in the same circle, He would love to make some
    new friends, and he perfer to meet people individually, which make him more
    comfortable.
